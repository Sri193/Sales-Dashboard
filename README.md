# 🚴‍♂️ Sales Performance Dashboard – Bicycle Shop (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** built using **Power BI** for a Bicycle Shop.  
The dashboard provides a centralized view of sales, profit, growth trends, and product performance, enabling stakeholders to make faster and data-driven decisions.

It transforms raw transactional data into actionable insights using effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and business-focused visualizations.

## 🎯 Key Business Questions
The dashboard is designed to answer the following questions:

- How are sales performing across **regions, products, and time**?
- Which **products and regions** drive the highest **revenue and profit**?
- Are **sales and profit targets** being met consistently?
- Which segments or products are **underperforming**?

## 🧩 Business Problem
The business lacked a consolidated reporting system to:
- Monitor overall sales and profitability
- Track performance trends over time
- Identify top-performing and underperforming products or regions

**Objective:**  
To build a centralized, interactive dashboard that improves visibility and supports strategic decision-making.

## 📂 Data Sources
The analysis uses structured retail sales data from the following sources:

- **Sales Transactions** – Order-level sales, profit, quantity, and dates  
- **Product Master Data** – Category, sub-category, and product details  
- **Customer Data** – Customer information and segments  
- **Date Dimension** – Calendar attributes for time-based analysis  

**Source:** Kaggle (Superstore / Retail Sales Dataset – CSV)

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed transactional data using **Power Query**
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Standardized data types
- Created relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Designed a **Star Schema** for optimized reporting

### 🔹 KPI Design
Key performance indicators created using **DAX**:

- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Profit Margin (%)  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth  
- Average Order Value  
- Units Sold  

### 🔹 Dashboard Design
The dashboard includes:

- **Executive Summary Page** with key KPIs  
- **Trend Analysis** using time intelligence (MoM / YoY)  
- **Regional and Product-Level Breakdown**  
- **Interactive Slicers** for Time, Region, and Product  

The design focuses on clarity, consistency, and ease of use.

## 📊 Key Insights
- A small number of products and regions contribute significantly to total revenue
- Clear seasonal patterns observed in monthly sales trends
- Some high-sales products have lower profit margins
- Customer segments show varied contribution to revenue
- Underperforming regions and products were easily identified

## 🚀 Business Outcome
- Faster and more effective decision-making
- Improved visibility into sales performance
- Identification of underperforming segments and products
- Better alignment of sales strategy with business goals

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
